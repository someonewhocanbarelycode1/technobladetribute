I had one of my siblings call me Dave one time in a deleted video from 2016, and it was one of the most successful pranks we\'ve ever done. Thousands of creepy online dudes trying to get overly personal, going, \'Oh, hey, Dave, how\'s it going?\' Sorry for selling out so much in the past year, but thanks to everyone that bought hoodies, plushies, and channel memberships. My siblings are goin\' to collegeâ€”well, if they want to. I don\'t wanna put any dead-brother peer pressure on them. But that\'s all from me. Thank you all for supporting my content over the years. If I had another hundred lives, I think I would choose to be Technoblade again every single time, as those were the happiest years of my life. I hope you guys enjoyed my content, and that I made some of you laugh. And I hope you all go on to live long, prosperous, and happy lives. Because I love you guys. Technoblade out.")

All you have is a tree, some supplies and some dirt to stand on. You have to treasure EVERY dirt block, because if one falls into the void, there\'s no way to replace it and as you carefully navigate your absurd circumstance, you gain a new appreciation for the few things you have as you meticulously use them to their fullest effect. With nothing but some ice, lava and saplings you slowly transform this empty expanse into a world of your very own. Skyblock teaches us that no matter how ridiculous the odds may seem, within us resides the power to overcome these challenges and achieve something beautiful. That one day, we\'ll look back at where we started and be amazed by how far we\'ve come.")
